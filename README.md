# TN_COVID19
Weekly summary of COVID19 activity and vaccination data in Tennessee.

This repo maintains the source files for the weekly (each Wed.) update at https://jmluther.github.io/TN_COVID19/ 

Data comes from [TNDOH](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov.html) and US data from  the [CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days). Formerly I used the [COVID Tracking project](https://covidtracking.com/data#state-tn), but this site is no longer updating data as of March 7, 2021.

Data used in the analysis is not duplicated on github, but the code to download the files can be found in `code/Download all data.R`
