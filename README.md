# TN_COVID19
Daily summary of COVID19 activity and vaccination data.

This repo maintains the source files for the daily update at https://jmluther.github.io/TN_COVID19/ 

Data comes from [TNDOH](https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov.html) and US data from  the [CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days). Formerly I used the [COVID Tracking project](https://covidtracking.com/data#state-tn), but this site is no longer updating data as of March 7, 2021.

Data used in the analysis is not duplicated here, but the code to download the files can be found in `code/Download all data.R`
